//Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
// The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
//Middleware functions can execute tasks , make changes to the req and res objects, can end the request-response cycle , can cal the next middleware function in the task

// If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.
